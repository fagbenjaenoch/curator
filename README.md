# Curator

Curator extracts keywords from your documents and generates search queries to help you research better.

It works by parsing your document, extracting the text and running it through a keyword Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (keyBERT for short) to identify the keywords or key phrases in your document which is used to generate a search query. It's that straighforward.
